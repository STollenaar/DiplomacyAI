AI for the game diplomacy

Providing an username and password it can login for you, check which games you are playing in and see if you can make a move in that game.
Currently it can only do random moves. 
There is no real strategy yet on how the AI decides what action to make and whether or not that action is attacking or defending.


This AI uses superagent to login and keep track of the cookies and uses puppeteer to set the dropbox menus and perform certain console commands in order for it to process certain information.
